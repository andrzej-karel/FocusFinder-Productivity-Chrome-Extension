# Privacy Policy for FocusFinder

## Introduction
This Privacy Policy explains how FocusFinder collects, uses, and safeguards information when installed as a browser extension. FocusFinder is available for desktop browsers Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome.

## Information Collection
FocusFinder does not collect any personally identifiable information. The extension only processes URLs and tab data necessary for providing tab search and management functionality, and this data never leaves the browser or local device.

## Data Storage and Processing
All data processed by FocusFinder is stored locally on the user's device. No data is transmitted to external servers, sold, or shared with any third parties. The extension operates entirely within the browser environment.

## Permissions Required
FocusFinder requires access to browser tabs and browsing history solely to provide tab search and management capabilities. These permissions are essential for the core functionality of quickly finding and navigating between open tabs.

## Third-Party Services
FocusFinder does not integrate with or utilize any third-party analytics, tracking, or advertising services.

## Browser Policies
As FocusFinder is available for both Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome, users should be aware that the respective privacy policies of these browsers also apply.

## Children's Privacy
The extension is not directed toward individuals under the age of 13 and does not knowingly collect information from children.

## Changes to This Policy
This Privacy Policy may be updated periodically. Any material changes will be communicated to users through the extension store listing or within the extension itself.
